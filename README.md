# Text Only
Text Only is a text-only list of text-only websites.

## How To Contribute
Text Only accepts submissions in the form of pull requests. If your eyes haven't glazed over yet, I'll assume you're comfortable submitting PRs. Fork this repo and follow the steps below (make sure to swap in your Github username if you're copy/pasting) to submit a new text-only website.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/textonly
cd textonly
npm install
bundle install
jekyll build
gulp
```

Follow those steps and you'll have the project cloned, the dependencies installed and a server running at ```http://localhost:3000```. From there, you can add your submission by following the data structure in websites.yml. Push your changes and submit a pull request. We're all busy, so if this seems like an undue hassle, just DM me on Twitter, I'll review your submission and add it to the list if it fits!
