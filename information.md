_"Fonts, stylesheets, images &amp; javascript? Never heard of them!"_

Text Only loads only text. All of that other stuff is great but it makes the internet slooooow. Now imagine you're in an area without adequate internet coverage or in the middle of a natural disaster without access to the internet at all; every kb counts. Text Only showcases websites that can still offer a good experience while being data accessible.

It's also worth mentioning that since there is No Javascript Allowed on this site, I'm not tracking visitors and selling advertising against them. Jokes on me, I guess.

Text Only is powered by Jekyll. It takes a bunch of markdown &amp; .yml data and spits out beautiful, unadorned HTML. Quick &amp; easy. If you're interested in that kind of nerd stuff, [check out the source here](https://github.com/joshosbrn/textonly).
