#### Why?
Recent natural disasters in the United States and abroad have reinforced the need for low-bandwith, fast, text-only news experiences on the web. It's only right that there exists a fast, text-only home for all of those sites.

#### How?
textonly.website is powered by Jekyll and not much else. It's uniquely suited to take a bunch of markdown (and in this case .yml) and spit out a bunch of beautiful, unadorned HTML. Quick & easy. If you're interested in that kind of nerd stuff, [check out the source here](#).
